# JIT Firmware Execution Service

# Runbook: JIT OCI-to-Redfish Firmware Deployment (Cray EX)

## 1. Environment and Toolchain Initialization

To comply with HPC environment constraints, the required toolchains (Go and ORAS) were installed directly into the user's home directory, and the execution environment was staged in the scratch partition.

**Commands Executed:**

```bash
# Initialize staging directory
mkdir -p /scratch/$USER/firmware-testing 
cd /scratch/$USER/firmware-testing

# Install Go compiler
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
tar -C $HOME -xzf go1.22.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz 
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin

# Install ORAS CLI
curl -LO https://github.com/oras-project/oras/releases/download/v1.2.0/oras_1.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz
mkdir -p $HOME/bin
tar -zxf oras_1.2.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz -C $HOME/bin oras
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin

```

**Mechanism:** This bypasses system-level package managers and provides the localized binaries required to compile the Fabrica service and interact with the OCI registry.

## 2. OCI Registry and Artifact Staging

The deployment model replaces traditional static HTTP file servers with a standard OCI distribution registry.

**Commands Executed:**

```bash
# Start the local OCI registry using Podman, explicitly mapping port 5000
podman run -d -p 5000:5000 --replace --name local-oci-registry registry:2

# Download the physical Cray firmware payload from the internal network
curl -O http://rgw-vip.hmn:8080/fw-update/2d64752c1cad11f1aeaa62a6103f192d/NC-1.10.2-22-s.tar.gz

# Push the payload to the registry as a custom OCI artifact
oras push 127.0.0.1:5000/firmware/cray-bmc:1.10.2 \
  --plain-http \
  --artifact-type application/vnd.openchami.firmware.bundle.v1+json \
  NC-1.10.2-22-s.tar.gz:application/vnd.openchami.firmware.payload.v1

```

**Mechanism:** The `oras push` command mathematically hashes the 58MB `NC-1.10.2-22-s.tar.gz` file, stores it by its SHA-256 digest, and generates an OCI manifest linking the tag `1.10.2` to that digest. Explicitly utilizing `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` forces IPv4 routing, avoiding the IPv6 loopback trap (`dial tcp [::1]:5000: connect: connection refused`) that previously caused the push to fail.

## 3. The Fabrica Service Code Modifications

Before execution, the Go reconciler required three specific modifications to accommodate Cray hardware and payload sizes:

1. **Redfish URI Adjustment:** The standard DMTF path was modified to the Cray-specific implementation: `/redfish/v1/UpdateService/Actions/SimpleUpdate`.
2. **Redfish Payload Adjustment:** The JSON struct was updated to inject `"TransferProtocol": "HTTP"`, a strict requirement for Cray BMCs to initiate the pull.
3. **Proxy Streaming & HEAD Support:** The ORAS client limits memory-buffered downloads to 4MB to prevent out-of-memory crashes. Because the Cray payload is roughly 58MB, the proxy endpoint was rewritten to use `io.Copy`, streaming the bytes directly from the registry to the BMC without holding them in memory. The router was also updated to accept HTTP `HEAD` requests, allowing the BMC to verify the `Content-Length` header before initiating the full 58MB transfer.

## 4. Execution and Orchestration

With the registry populated and the code compiled, the service was started and the deployment job was submitted.

**Commands Executed:**

```bash
# Start the service in the background
go run ./cmd/server serve --port 8090 --database-url="file:hpc_test.db?cache=shared&_fk=1" &

# Submit the Just-In-Time orchestration job
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/firmwareupdatejobs/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
  "metadata": {"name": "live-cray-update-retry"},
  "spec": {
    "targetAddress": "x9000c3s7b1",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "initial0",
    "ociReference": "127.0.0.1:5000/firmware/cray-bmc:1.10.2",
    "targets": ["/redfish/v1/UpdateService/FirmwareInventory/BMC"],
    "serverProxyAddress": "10.254.1.20"
  }
}'

```

**Mechanism:** The `serverProxyAddress` of `10.254.1.20` is the specific IPv4 address of the Non-Compute Node (NCN) on the `bond0.hmn0` interface. The background reconciler extracted the SHA-256 digest from the OCI registry, constructed the download URI (`http://10.254.1.20:8090/firmware-proxy/layer/sha256:...`), and pushed that URI to the BMC via Redfish. The BMC then routed its download request back through the Hardware Management Network to the Fabrica proxy.

## 5. Hardware Validation

The BMC was queried to confirm the state transition.

**Command Executed:**

```bash
curl -k -u root:initial0 https://x9000c3s7b1/redfish/v1/UpdateService/FirmwareInventory/BMC | jq

```

**Output:**

```json

                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

{
  "@odata.etag": "W/\"1781212049\"",
  "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/UpdateService/FirmwareInventory/BMC",
  "@odata.type": "#SoftwareInventory.v1_1_0.SoftwareInventory",
  "Description": "Baseboard Management Controller",
  "Id": "BMC",
  "Name": "BMC",
  "SoftwareId": "nc:*:*:*",
  "Status": {
    "Health": "OK",
    "State": "Enabled"
  },
  "Updateable": true,
  "Version": "nc.1.10.2-22-shasta-release.arm.2026-01-15T01:13:10+00:00.a0bcef9"
}

```

**Mechanism:** The absence of the `Conditions` array containing the `HPEFirmwareUpdate.1.0.DownloadFailed` warning indicates the proxy transfer succeeded. The `State: Enabled` and `Health: OK` fields confirm the BMC verified the binary signature, applied the flash update, and rebooted the controller using the specified `nc.1.10.2-22...` version.

## 1. Overview and Operational Philosophy

The JIT (Just-In-Time) Firmware Execution Service is a stateless orchestration engine designed to deploy firmware binaries directly from OCI registries to hardware Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs) using the Redfish standard.

Unlike traditional firmware management tools, this service maintains zero local inventory or catalog tracking of available firmware files. It does not actively crawl or index OCI registries. Instead, it relies on a declarative, on-demand execution model driven entirely by the `FirmwareUpdateJob` resource.

When a job is requested, the service evaluates the OCI reference dynamically, discovers the precise payload locations via the ORAS protocol, registers a localized routing target for the data, and hands off the transfer to the BMC. The service then serves as a transparent proxy, streaming bytes straight from the remote OCI layer to the hardware without writing the binary data to its local disk.

## 2. Technical Architecture and Data Flow

The lifecycle of an execution request spans 6 logical stages across the client, the Fabrica server core, the OCI registry, and the physical hardware.

```text
[ Client ] ------------ 1. POST Job ------------> [ Fabrica Server ]
                                                          |
                                                  2. Pull Manifest
                                                          v
                                                 [ OCI Registry ]
                                                          |
                                                  3. Return Digest
                                                          v
[ BMC Hardware ] <----- 4. Redfish SimpleUpdate -- [ Fabrica Server ]
       |
       +--------------- 5. GET Proxy Layer -------------->|
                                                          |
                                                  6. Stream Blob
                                                          v
[ BMC Hardware ] <====== Binary Byte Stream ======= [ OCI Registry ]

```

1. **Job Creation:** An external automation platform or operator issues an HTTP POST containing the target BMC details, credentials, and the explicit OCI image location.
2. **Just-In-Time Resolution:** The background reconciliation loop identifies the new request, sets the internal state to `Resolving`, and connects to the specified OCI registry using `oras-go/v2`.
3. **Manifest Inspection:** The service fetches the OCI manifest layer, confirms the presence of the validation header `application/vnd.openchami.firmware.bundle.v1+json`, and extracts the exact SHA-256 digest of the underlying firmware binary.
4. **Redfish Dispatch:** The service saves a temporary mapping of the SHA-256 digest to its source OCI repository paths. It then triggers an outbound HTTPS POST to the BMC's `/redfish/v1/UpdateService/Actions/UpdateService.SimpleUpdate` route. The payload informs the BMC that its update file is hosted at the service's internal HTTP proxy route: `http://<serverProxyAddress>:8090/firmware-proxy/layer/<digest>`.
5. **Proxy Request:** The BMC processes the instruction and makes an inbound HTTP GET call back to the Fabrica server proxy endpoint to pull down the binary.
6. **Passthrough Streaming:** The proxy endpoint reads the internal map to locate the appropriate upstream OCI repository, initializes a data stream from the registry via ORAS, and flushes the bytes directly into the BMC's HTTP response buffer.

## 4. End-to-End Workflow Automation Script

This shell script provides a self-contained test workflow. It establishes a local isolated registry, produces a simulated payload, injects it into the OCI system via the ORAS CLI, spins up the server infrastructure, executes a JIT job request, and tests the proxy endpoints.

## 5. Critical Engineering and Network Constraints

* **Asynchronous API Contracts:** The API returns an immediate `201 Created` code when a job is posted, confirming structural integrity and persistence to the SQLite database. Actual work occurs on background processing threads. Systems driving this API must poll the individual job resource endpoint to capture the definitive status or failure traces.
* **TLS Policy Constraints:** Outbound communication to target hardware addresses defaults exclusively to HTTPS using insecure validation configurations (`InsecureSkipVerify: true`). This accommodation is mandatory to tolerate the self-signed TLS certificates natively generated by bare-metal BMC components in unprovisioned environments.
* **Proxy Address Accuracy:** The `serverProxyAddress` property declared inside the job spec must be accurately routable from the isolated management VLAN hosting the physical BMC. If this address is misconfigured or blocked by intermediate firewalls over port `8090`, the target hardware will timeout during the payload pull phase, causing the overall job status to remain stuck or transition to `Failed`.
