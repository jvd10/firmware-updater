# JIT Firmware Execution Service

## Overview

The Firmware Execution Service is a stateless orchestration engine designed to deploy firmware binaries directly from OCI registries to hardware controllers (BMCs, Chassis Controllers, Cabinet Controllers) using the Redfish standard.

The service maintains zero local inventory. It utilizes a declarative, on-demand execution model driven by the `FirmwareUpdateJob` resource. Upon receiving a job, the service dynamically queries the target hardware's Redfish `UpdateService` to discover its specific update URI. It then establishes a direct stream from the upstream OCI registry, utilizing `io.Copy` to flush the bytes directly into the hardware's response buffer without writing the payload to local disk.

## Operating Modes

The service supports two distinct operating methods for payload resolution:

1. **Discovery Mode:** The service autonomously queries an OCI repository using the ORAS protocol. It downloads available manifests, filters them by matching a requested hardware model against OCI annotations, parses the version annotations, and automatically resolves the highest semantic version (e.g., when targeting `latest`).
2. **Explicit Mode:** A manual override pathway where the user provides the exact OCI path and SHA digest, bypassing all annotation filtering and version resolution.

## Prerequisites

* **Go Toolchain:** Required to compile and run the Fabrica service.
* **ORAS CLI:** Required by publishers to attach strict OCI annotations when uploading firmware binaries to the registry.
* **Network Routing:** The `serverProxyAddress` property specified in the job payload must be an IPv4 address accurately routable from the isolated management VLAN hosting the physical hardware. If misconfigured, the target hardware will time out when attempting to pull the payload stream.

## Publisher Workflow: Staging Firmware in the OCI Registry

For Discovery Mode to function, the service must trust the metadata in the OCI registry. Publishers must push the firmware binary using ORAS and attach specific annotations to the manifest.

* `dev.fabrica.hardware.compatible`: A string or comma-separated list defining the hardware models the binary supports.
* `org.opencontainers.image.version`: The strict Semantic Version of the payload.

### Push Command

```bash
oras push 127.0.0.1:5000/firmware/cray-bmc:1.10.2 --plain-http --artifact-type application/vnd.openchami.firmware.bundle.v1+json --annotation "dev.fabrica.hardware.compatible=x9000" --annotation "org.opencontainers.image.version=1.10.2" NC-1.10.2-22-s.tar.gz:application/vnd.openchami.firmware.payload.v1

```

```

## End-User Workflow: Executing a Firmware Update Job

To initiate an update, the user submits a `FirmwareUpdateJob` resource. In Discovery Mode, the user specifies the hardware model (`x9000`), the repository path, and the target version (`latest`). The user does not need to know the SHA digest.

### Submit Job Command

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8090/firmwareupdatejobs/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"metadata": {"name": "live-cray-discovery-bmc"}, "spec": {"targetAddress": "x9000c3s7b1", "username": "root", "password": "initial0", "serverProxyAddress": "10.254.1.20", "component": "BMC", "discovery": {"repository": "127.0.0.1:5000/firmware/cray-bmc", "hardwareModel": "x9000", "version": "latest"}}}'

```

### Output

```json
{
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "kind": "FirmwareUpdateJob",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "live-cray-discovery-bmc",
    "uid": "firmwareupdatejob-8eab5b0e",
    "createdAt": "2026-06-17T22:32:39.066344171Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-17T22:32:39.066344171Z"
  },
  "spec": {
    "targetAddress": "x9000c3s7b1",
    "username": "root",
    "password": "initial0",
    "discovery": {
      "repository": "127.0.0.1:5000/firmware/cray-bmc",
      "hardwareModel": "x9000",
      "version": "latest"
    },
    "component": "BMC",
    "serverProxyAddress": "10.254.1.20"
  },
  "status": {}
}

```

## Monitoring and Validation

The update process operates asynchronously on background threads. The service writes the resolved version and digest into the status block of the job once discovery completes, providing a permanent record of what "latest" evaluated to at execution time.

### Check Service Resolution Status

```bash
curl -k http://127.0.0.1:8090/firmwareupdatejobs/firmwareupdatejob-8eab5b0e

```

### Output

```json
{

    "uid": "firmwareupdatejob-8eab5b0e",
    "createdAt": "2026-06-17T22:32:39.066344171Z",
    "updatedAt": "2026-06-17T22:32:42.01724319Z"

    },

  }
}

```

### Verify Hardware State

Query the hardware directly via Redfish to verify it has successfully accepted the payload stream from the service.

```bash
curl -sk -u root:initial0 https://x9000c3s7b1/redfish/v1/UpdateService/FirmwareInventory/BMC

```
